      <p>
        If you&#39;d told me a year ago I&#39;d be a UI/UX designer at Mecwin, juggling prototypes, mentors, and enough 
        coffee to fuel a small nation, I&#39;d have snorted into my coffee. Yet here I am, almost 12 months later, thriving in 
        the chaos of a startup that&#39;s equal parts exhilarating and “what did I sign up for?” Buckle up, because 
        I&#39;m about to take you on a wild ride through my first year at Mecwin. Complete with scrappy freelance flashbacks, 
        design disasters, and a few heroes who kept me sane. Spoiler: It&#39;s been a blast. 😎
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Freelance Flashback: When I Was a Hot Mess with a Laptop</b></p>
      <p>
        Let&#39;s rewind. Second year of engineering, fresh off a Web Dev 101 workshop, and I&#39;m still confusing CSS with 
        a cry for help. Four days later, I snag my first freelance gig, building a website for a friend's venture. I&#39;m equal 
        parts thrilled and terrified, googling “how to invoice” at 2 a.m. The client loved it, word spread, and 
        suddenly I&#39;m a “designer” hustling gigs, dodging deadlines, and learning that clients don&#39;t care about your 
        excuses, just your results. Freelancing was my bootcamp: chaotic, scrappy, and a masterclass in faking it 
        till you make it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Mecwin called. Joining as a UI/UX Designer felt like swapping a tricycle for a rocket ship. Fast, 
        thrilling, and mildly panic inducing. My first gig? Helping shape Mecwin Nethra, our star product - a remote monitoring 
        system for IoT. No pressure, right?
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Early Days: Surviving the Feedback Furnace</b></p>
      <p>
        My first few months at Mecwin were a blur of ambition and amateur hour. I dove into redesigning Mecwin Nethra 
        V1&#39;s UI, armed with big dreams and a shaky prototype. I wanted it to dazzle. Instead, I got roasted.
      </p>

            <b>💡 Pro Tip: </b><br>(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ:･ﾟ✧ “Feedback&#39;s not a punchline—it&#39;s the punch that makes you better.”

        Take RiteWaters, one of our key distributors. I strutted in with my flashy demo, expecting applause. 
        They squinted and said, “It&#39;s cool, but newbies will drown in this.” Oof. Feedback&#39;s like a slap from a 
        dosa pan — hot, sharp, and humbling. I scrapped the over the top animations, streamlined the onboarding, 
        and guess what? Beta tests showed a 30% faster adoptability. Turns out less is more, and I&#39;m not just talking 
        about my sleep.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Project That Tested My Soul (and My Sanity)</b></p>
      <p>
        This year threw me into the deep end, and I swam, sometimes gracefully, sometimes like a struggling duck. Here&#39;s the rundown:
      </p>
      <p><b>Mecwin Nethra V1.0</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Mission: </b>Design the UI through a gauntlet of revisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Lesson: </b>Design is like a needy houseplant. Nurture it, prune it, and don&#39;t cry when it wilts.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Mobile App Prototype</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Mission: </b>Build a snappy companion app.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Lesson: </b>Mobile users are speed demons. If it lags, they&#39;re gone faster than free samosas at a party.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Internal Dashboard Redesign</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Mission: </b>Tame a data swamp into operator friendly bliss.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Lesson: </b>Clarity&#39;s king, and chaos is just a headache with extra steps.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These weren&#39;t just projects; they were my personal comedy of errors. Each fumble a chance to laugh, learn, and level up.
      </p>

      <p>More on other projects, I'll detail in a different blog, let us allow the star of the show have all the highlight this time around.</p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Mentorship: My Startup Superheroes</b></p>
      <p>
        I didn&#39;t survive this year alone. Enter Wrushya GS and Tejas Tallam. The Batman and Robin of my Mecwin saga.
      </p>

      <p><b>Wrushya GS: The Big-Picture Boss</b></p>
      <div class="credit">
        <p class="speech">
          <span class="bubble">
            <b>💡 Wrushya Wisdom:</b> “Make it meaningful—pretty&#39;s just the cherry on top.”
            <span class="arrow"></span>
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Wrushya, our AGM, built our team from the ground up. He&#39;s a business analyst, ex-entrepreneur 
        (sold his own company. Humblebrag much?) and the guy who asks “Why does this matter?” He&#39;d poke my 
        designs with, “Who&#39;s this for?” or “How&#39;s it pushing us forward?” His hustle vibes made me see design as 
        a game changer, not just eye candy. I still remember his first question to me: "Are you hungry for knowledge?"
      </p>

            <b>💡 Tejas Truth:</b> “If it doesn&#39;t gel with the system, it&#39;s just a fancy doodle.”
            <span class="arrow"></span>
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Then there&#39;s Tejas, our Department Head and embedded engineering guru with 20+ years of cred 
        (including DRDO—yes, that DRDO). He swooped in when Wrushya went big-picture, asking, “Does this UI sync 
        with the hardware?” Tejas turned me into a timeline ninja and a tech savvy designer who doesn&#39;t just doodle, he 
        delivers.

      <p><b>Startup Life: Where “Designer” Means Everything Else Too</b></p>
      <p>
        At Mecwin, UI/UX is my title, but my job? A glorious grab bag of chaos. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve tackled:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Hiring Squad:</b> Interviewed candidates. Turns out spotting talent is tougher than spotting a good biryani joint.

            <b>Customer Whisperer:</b> Handled client calls, soaking up gripes and gold nuggets of insight.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Marketing Maverick:</b> Wrote LinkedIn posts and official social media handle management. Spoiler: 280 characters are harder than a wireframe.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Server Juggler:</b> Managed DevOps stuff. Now I get why coders worship coffee.
          </p>

            <b>IT Fixer:</b> Solved tech glitches. I&#39;m the office&#39;s unofficial tech therapist.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Team Herder:</b> Kept projects on track. It&#39;s cat-herding with extra brilliance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Hardware Rookie:</b> Tested components. Nearly fried a board once, good times. (That was a lie, it did burn)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Agile Methodology:</b> Setting up an agile process for the software team using Linear App and Slack.

            <b>💡 Startup Secret:</b> “Juggling hats builds empathy, not just caffeine tolerance.”
            <span class="arrow"></span>
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Why the madness? Startups don&#39;t do “stay in your lane.” This circus has made me a designer who gets the big picture; users, tech, and all of its glory.</p>

      <p><b>Dr. Shiva: The Brain Behind the Bold</b></p>
      <div class="credit">
        <p class="speech">
          <span class="bubble">
            <b>💡 Shiva&#39;s Gem:</b> “Design&#39;s not just for users. It&#39;s for the bottom line too.”

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Then there&#39;s Dr. Shiva, our Director and strategy wizard. Working with him is like sneaking into the CEO&#39;s 
        playbook. He&#39;d squint at my sleek UI and go, “How&#39;s this scaling us up?” Boom, mind blown. I started designing 
        for growth, not just giggles. His “you&#39;re the expert, prove it” vibe gave me the guts to own my work, while 
        his innovation obsession pushed us to toy with AI and much more for Mecwin.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Keeping the Crazy in Check</b></p>
      <p>
        Freelancing taught me to say “yes” to everything; Mecwin taught me “not today, Satan.” Some weeks were 
        fueled by pure adrenaline (and espresso), but I&#39;ve learned to sneak in bike rides through the outskirts of Bangalore or a weekend 
        Netflix binge or night rides through the Airport road. A rested me is a sharper me. Figma crashes don&#39;t sting as much.
