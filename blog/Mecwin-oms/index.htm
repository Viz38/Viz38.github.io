      <p>
        As part of our digitisation of the firm, OMS is the main project that ambitiously aims to streamline the entire 
        order management process. The project is a complex one, involving multiple stakeholders and a wide range of features.
        Nonetheless, major fousus was on improving the efficiency, accountability and transparency of the order management. To 
        explain the rest of the requirements lets dive into a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a blistering summer day in rural Maharashtra, and Ravi, a farmer with a sun weathered face, is on the phone, 
        fuming. “I’ve been waiting for my solar pump for weeks, and no one knows where it is!” he yells, loud 
        enough to scare the crows off his field. Back at Mecwin HQ in Bangalore, the scene wasn’t much prettier. Sales 
        reps wading through paper piles, production teams scribbling on logs, and management squinting at spreadsheets 
        like they’re ancient hieroglyphs. Not to mention how the CSR had to rush to the sales department to relay the call.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seven years ago, we were the B2C champs, delivering solar pumps to farmers 
        like Ravi with ease. But as we pivoted to B2B, our old system buckled. Chaos reigned. Enter Mecwin OMS 
        (Order Management System)—the digital hero we didn’t know we needed. This isn’t just a tech tale; it’s about 
        turning mayhem into magic, one solar pump at a time. Buckle up—let’s ride through the transformation! 🌞
      </p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p><b>The Big Why: Chaos Was Costing Us</b></p>
      <p>
        Mecwin Technologies India Pvt. Ltd. lives by the motto “Empowering the Future” with solar-powered solutions, 
        but our order process? It was stuck in the stone age. Customers like Ravi were left guessing about delivery 
        dates, sales reps were buried under phone calls, and production teams tracked pumps with paper and prayers. 
        The numbers told a grim story: 30% of orders lagged by 5+ days, 25% of payments were botched, and 
        inefficiencies bled us ₹10,00,000 annually. Our shift from B2C to B2B exposed the cracks. Distributors 
        demanded speed, and our manual mess couldn’t deliver.
      </p>

        <p class="speech">
          <span class="bubble">
            When Ravi said, “I’d rather haul water with a bucket than deal with this,” we knew it was time to act.
            <span class="arrow"></span>
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Mecwin OMS was born to fix this: a web and mobile platform to automate orders from start to finish, 
        with realtime tracking and transparency for all. We aimed to cut delays, boost satisfaction, and save 
        cash—all while keeping it so simple Ravi could use it after a long day in the fields.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Digging into the Mess: Research That Lit the Way</b></p>
      <p>
        To build OMS, we rolled up our sleeves and got dirty, figuratively, though I did spill coffee on my 
        notes once. Here’s what we uncovered:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Stakeholder Vibes:</b> 
            Ravi hated the slow, opaque process. Sales reps were swamped with approvals. Production teams 
            lost pumps in the shuffle. Management craved visibility.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Field Notes:</b> 
            Watching Ravi order a pump took 20 minutes of phone tag, just to confirm specs! Meanwhile, 
            the Accounts Team drowned in payment verification calls.
          </p>
        </li>
        <div class="credit">
          <p class="speech">
            <span class="bubble">
              The Accounts Team’s groan at “manual payment checks” was louder than my espresso machine. Not to 
              mention how tired our CSR was at the end of the day, though she was an expert speedster with a 
              calculator now.🤣
              <span class="arrow"></span>
            </span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Data Dive:</b> 
            With approximately 500 orders monthly, 20% were delayed, and 15% of payments went haywire, costing us 
            a minimum of ₹10,00,000 a year in rework.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Lightbulb Moment:</b> 
            WorkRoute with real-time tracking inspired me, why not give Ravi that same clarity? We live in an era of 
            automation and transparency, no boss wants to come down to the factory and yell at every employee till the 
            work gets done. Micro management has become something of the past.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The takeaway? Everyone was fed up, but automation and simplicity could save the day.</p>

      <p><b>The Workflow: Mess to Masterpiece</b></p>
      <p>OMS breaks it into three slick modules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Sales Order: </b>
            Placement, assignment, negotiation, confirmation — ✅Done.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Production: </b>
            Planning, materials, assembly, testing, packaging — 🏆Sorted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Dispatch & Delivery: </b>
            Approvals, shipping, OTP confirmation — 🚚Delivered.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every step syncs updates for Ravi and the team, so no one’s left guessing.</p>
