      <p><b>From a College Workshop to a Thriving Personal Brand</b></p>
      <p>
        I still remember the first time I dipped my toes into freelancing. It was four days after attending a 
        <a href="https://glugpace.org/events/web-designing/"><b>Web Dev 101 workshop</b></a> in my second year of 
        engineering. My first gig wasn&#39;t just a random local business, it was a travel agency in Georgia, a new 
        business venture - <a href="https://viz38.github.io/SkyHighTravels/"><b>SkyHighTravels</b></a> (Discontinued in 2024) by a close friend who had gone abroad for higher studies. Designing their website was both 
        exciting and nerve wracking, but once I saw it live, I was hooked.

        Fast forward to today 🎯, I&#39;ve worked on multiple freelance projects across diverse industries like SaaS, indie makers 
        finance, real estate, performing arts, early stage startups and even food photography. But what&#39;s more important than just the 
        projects is what freelancing has taught me: the delicate balance between work and life.

      <p><b>Why Work-Life Balance Matters in Freelancing</b></p>
      <p>
        When you&#39;re freelancing, you&#39;re not just a designer, developer, or strategist. You&#39;re also your own <b>project 
        manager, accountant, marketer, and customer support</b>. With no fixed hours or defined office space, it&#39;s easy 
        for work to blend into personal life. But that&#39;s where <b>work-life balance becomes crucial</b>.
        <br><br>
        Some hard-learned lessons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            🔥 <b>Burnout is real</b> – Working round the clock kills creativity faster than bad coffee. I've always 
            designed better after a good rest than sprinting all night.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            ⏳ <b>Setting boundaries</b> – Just because you work from home doesn&#39;t mean you should work all the time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            📅 <b>Schedule like a pro</b> – Have a structured day, even if you're your own boss. This would ensure you 
            divide your time based on yout tasks and you leave time for yourself.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>Freelancing Freedom ≠ Always Available</b></p>
      <p>
        A major mistake new freelancers make? Thinking availability equals success. Spoiler alert: it doesn&#39;t. 
        Clients appreciate professionals who are clear about their availability but also deliver quality work.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>The Reality of Juggling Multiple Projects</b></p>
      <p>
        I&#39;ve worked with clients from <a href="https://intelliarx.com/">IntelliArx</a> (SaaS, AI/ML, Blockchain) to <a href="https://malnaddreams.com/">Malnad Dreams</a> (regional promotion) and 
        <a href="https://greenstoronto.com/">Greens Toronto</a> (finance & insurance brokerage). Each project came with its own challenges, from tight deadlines 
        to unique design expectations. But with every gig, I refined my process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>✅ Structured Workflows:</b>
            <br>
            Setting up proper milestones and expectations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>✅ Automating the Boring Stuff:</b>
            <br>
            Streamlining scheduling, invoicing, and client communications to save time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>✅ Consistently Showcasing Work:</b>
            <br>
            Keeping my portfolio fresh and updated, making it easier to attract new clients.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Work-Life Balance Strategies That Work</b></p>
      <p>⚖️ Here&#39;s what&#39;s actually helped me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>1️⃣ <b>The Rule of Three:</b> No more than three high-priority tasks per day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            2️⃣ <b>Fixed Work Hours:</b> Treat freelancing like a job (even if it&#39;s a passion project).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            3️⃣ <b>Time Off is Sacred:</b> No work emails or revisions on weekends unless absolutely necessary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <p>
            💡 <b>Pro Tip:</b> Set clear client expectations from Day 1. If a project requires 3 weeks, don&#39;t promise it in 1. 
            The best clients respect your time when you respect your own time first.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>
      <p><b>The Freedom vs Discipline Balance</b></p>
      <p>
        Freelancing gives you freedom, but freedom without discipline is chaos. I&#39;ve learned (sometimes the hard way) 
        that while I love working on projects, I also love having time for personal growth, travel, and downtime. 
        Work-life balance isn&#39;t a luxury—it&#39;s a necessity for long-term success.
      </p>
      <p>
        🌟 To anyone diving into freelancing: Prioritize your health, set boundaries, and build a system that works 
        for you. Because <b>what&#39;s the point of financial freedom if you don&#39;t have time to enjoy it?</b>
      </p>
